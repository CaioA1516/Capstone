A project to practice my pygame skills
To run: python main.py

How to play:
Press the corresponding arrow keys when the colored arrows approach the stationary
arrows on the top. 5 points awarded for when both arrows overlap, 10 points awarded
for when the arrows almost coincide. Missed arrows disappear after leaving the screen.
After missing three arrows, the game ends, at which point it is possible to restart
by pressing any key.
